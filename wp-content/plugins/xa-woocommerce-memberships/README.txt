= What are membership websites? =

A lot of businesses thrive by providing restricted content to only certain privileged users. Such websites are called membership websites. Membership websites provide access to certain content that are limited to certain users we call members. Membership websites are a great way to earn passive and recurring income by restricting access to the content of the website. Since WordPress powers a major chunk of CMS based websites, WordPress membership plugins and WordPress membership themes are used to make such websites membership enabled. Similarly since WooCommerce powers majority of ecommerce websites, people use readily available WooCommerce membership plugins and WooCommerce membership themes for the same purpose.

In most of the membership websites, the members are charged automatically on a regular basis ( for eg, WooCommerce membership subscriptions) . The members will, of course, have an option to cancel the membership before the membership is renewed. These kinds of ecommerce membership websites ensure a predictable cash flow to the business.  

When you think of a membership website, a real life analogy would be a club or a gym where only the members are allowed in. The club charges its members on a regular basis since the time they join. These members will have special and privileged access to the service the club provides. At the same time, the members can also be a part of the community of members of the club. The members of the website will have certain identification method that will let them access the club.

This restricted access to the content is achieved by creating a barrier on the website. When you are creating a website using WordPress, creating this kind of a barrier can be achieved by simply installing a suitable plugin. The essence of a membership website is the barrier that only allows only the members to pass through. So, the first thing to do is establish that barrier on the website. Once the barrier is set the owner can decide what content is available to its members and non-members.

The members can be given options for different plans or membership levels. And they will be given different privileges depending on the membership plan they opt for. This gives the members option to choose what content they want to access and only pay accordingly. These privileges will not be available for non-members.

One of the most easily recognizable examples of an online membership business model would be Netflix. The business model of the Netflix is not just that of an online on-demand video streaming service. It provides content that is exclusive to the platform. And its members can access the content whenever they want, anywhere they want. Netflix charges its user to renew its membership, not for a particular content. The members may not even stream the content for a time, but Netflix will have a recurring income since the members are charged for the membership, not the content they are accessing.
But not all membership websites are the same. You can find many other examples of membership website like online courses, online journals, etc.

= What Makes a Membership Website Successful? =

The crucial ingredient in creating a successful membership website is to provide content that gives value to the users. The content of the website should be unique that the users will not get from anywhere else. When it comes to memberships website, the content is really the king.
For a membership website to succeed, it should have a great membership base. 

One noticeable business technique that we can take away from the example of NetFlix is that they provide a one-month free trial for every new user. This method can be applied to any kind of memberships website to increase their membership base. Providing certain content (or the portion of the content) or all of the content for a certain period of time without any cost can help the user familiarize or even get used to with the content that the membership provides. The users will always have the option to cancel the membership if they do not wish to continue using the services.

Next vital part of a membership website is the duration of the membership. Establish a time period until which the user will have access to the site, after which the membership will be renewed automatically unless the member opts to cancel the membership. This ensures the steady flow of income to the business on a regular basis.

= What do you need before creating a membership website? =

**Know your target audience**

This is the most important part prior to setting up a memberships website. Research a little bit about your target audience and assess the demand among that target audience. This will help you keep create targeted contents and keep in touch with the changes and demands thereby, improving the contents.

**The competitors**

Know the competitors in the area that you picked. If there are no serious competitors, then you are in luck as long as there is a market for what you do. If there is a reasonable competition out there, do a thorough research and find out what more and different you can do to stand out.

**Create a plan and set a policy**

Create a membership plan and pricing for the website. Decide beforehand how long a free and paid memberships should last, how the users can renew their memberships, how often are they going to be charged, different levels of memberships, etc. Do not set an unreasonable price right from the beginning. You might first want to lure the users in first, and once you have a strong foundation you may change the pricing plans in due course of time. Creating a mix of free and paid content can give you the best results.

**The technical aspects**

This includes the platform that you are going to build the website upon, the plugins that you want to use, and whether you need to hire a developer to do that, the design of the website, etc.

**The type of contents you are going to provide to your users**

Make a plan on how you are going to deliver on the content on a regular basis. Blogs, seminars, e-books, online courses, etc. are a few types and you may want to add more depending on the niche of the website. Access control is a key part of any wp memberships site.  Decide on what kind of content restriction you are planning.

**Be a part of other membership websites**
